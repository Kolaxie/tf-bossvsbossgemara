>Add a mannpower logo above player head (with no effect) to show their team

Additional Plugin for BvB: Raid and Ultra Round.

>Raid rounds are a special round that make a very powerfull spawn on the blue team and make all other bosses on the red team team up against it
>Add a custom plugin value "raid" "1/0" and "ultra" "1/0" for CFG files
>Raid rounds can be triggered by making them spawn via the TextStore plugin of BatFox, when someone use a Raid in the TextStore plugin, make message pop up in the chat for client with the [FF2] Tag (something like [FF2]Raid Selected, Get Ready) and remove it from player inventory
>Raid can either be forced or spawned via the TextStore plugin, if no raid is forced, give a 25% probability for spawn per map (Only 1 raid max per map, so if one is forced don't allow a random one to spawn or allow other player to spawn one)
>If the summoned raid is a duo or plus and the player is in a /ff2party make the party member be raid with him (if more than number of bosses pick the oldest person who joined the party)
>Random Raid selected player must be random
>During raid, disable the 15 minutes timer bleed and replace it with a stand alone version of the wave plugin of s93_blitzkrieg plugin (with customisable number of wave and time per wave in cfg)
>When raid spawn or after someone summon him with the TextStore menu, block all player from using one for the rest of the map and give a 180 minutes timer cooldown to the player who used it to use another one via the textstore plugin (ignored if random)
>When raid spawn, the user who used raid must spawn with it on the blue team while all the other players spawn on red team with their selected bosses

>Ultra round applies the same rules but add one new rule, the rule being that a random player is picked and get a boss from the Raid category and spawn on red with it

>Yeah, that's more of a "misc" thing but is it possible to add admin menu for raids and ultra access? (Forcing one, select one, reset someone timer etc)
>Can we just have an actual way of setting up audio files to be server wide or not in bosses cfg.
